# Python Fundamentals
### Introduction  
Python is a high-level, versatile programming language known for its simplicity and readability, making it ideal for beginners and experts alike.

### It Is Used For:  
- Web development (Django, Flask)  
- Data analysis and visualization  
- Machine Learning and AI  
- Automation and scripting  
- Game development  

### Why Python?  
- Easy-to-read syntax  
- Extensive libraries and frameworks  
- Large community support  
- Platform independence

#  Libraries in Python for AI/ML  
- Numpy: Numerical computations  
- Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis  
- Matplotlib/Seaborn: Data visualization  
- Scikit-learn: Classical ML algorithms  
- TensorFlow/PyTorch: Deep Learning frameworks  

---

#  Control Statements in Python
- Conditional Statements: `if`, `elif`, `else`  
- Loops: `for`, `while`  
- Break and Continue: To manage loop execution  

---

#  Functions in Python  
- Built-in Functions: e.g., `print()`, `len()`  
- User-defined Functions: Created with `def` keyword  

Example:  
```python  
def greet(name):  
    return f"Hello, {name}!"  
print(greet("Deepika"))  
```

---
